# Coffee-Sales

In this Dashboard I analyzed the sales data of a Coffee Store and visualized some of the KPIs of the business. 

I started off by populating some columns with VLOOKUP

I created various charts to display KPIs of the business and then proceeded to create an interactive dashboard to enable users filter and naviagte the data. 

The raw and finished files are both accessible in the repo.
